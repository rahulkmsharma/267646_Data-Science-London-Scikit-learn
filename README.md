## This Project is mainly focus on learning of Different classification algorithms

## the whole project is divided into 2 categories 
  1. Data Pre-Processing
  2. Model Building
## Data Preprocessing
  This project doesn't required too much data pre-processing technique because it mainly focuses on applying different machine learning algorithms and selecting which algorithms     is best suited for my dataset
  Data Preprocessing is maily consist of two parts 
  1. Splitting Data into test and train 
  2. Data Normalisation and Standardization
## Model Building 
  I have applied different classification algorithms which are stated as below with observed accuracy
   1. Logistic Regression

   |     Algorithms     |    Type       | Accuracy |
   |------------------------|---------------|------------
   | Logistic Regression    |    Simple     |  83.0%     |
   | Logistic Regression    |   Data Normalized     |  78.5%   |
   | Logistic Regression    |    Data Standardized    |  80.5% |
   
    2. Decision Tree

   |     Algorithms     |    Type       | Accuracy |
   |------------------------|---------------|------------
   | Decision Tree    |    Simple     |  73.5%     |
   | Decision Tree    |   Data Normalized     |  43.0%   |
   | Decision Tree    |    Data Standardized    |  65.5% |
   
    2. SVM(Support Vector Machine)

   |     Algorithms     |    Type       | Accuracy |
   |------------------------|---------------|------------
   | SVM    |    Simple     |  86.5%     |
   | SVM    |   Data Normalized     |  62.5%   |
   | SVM    |    Data Standardized    |  68.5% |
   
   2. KNN(K Nearest Neighbour)

   |     Algorithms     |    Type       | Accuracy |
   |------------------------|---------------|------------
   | KNN    |    Simple     |  88.0%     |
   | KNN    |   Data Normalized     |  86.5%   |
   | KNN    |    Data Standardized    |  88.0% |
   
   2. Random Forest

   |     Algorithms     |    Type       | Accuracy |
   |------------------------|---------------|------------
   | Random forest     |    Simple     |  85.5%     |
   | Randm Forest    |   Data Normalized     |  73.0%   |
   | Random Forest    |    Data Standardized    |  84.0% |
   
   ## Conclusion
    From above results i conclude that KNN is best suited algorithm for this problem therefore finally i am applying KNN algorithm to get output
